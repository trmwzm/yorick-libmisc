func asciiRead(file)
/* DOCUMENT data= asciiRead(name)
            data= asciiRead(file)
	read ascii numeric data in columns from file NAME, or the already
	open file FILE.
	The result is a NCOLUMNS-by-NLINES array of doubles.

	Data are read as double values arranged in columns separated
	by any number of spaces or tabs.  Comments starting with a "#"
	or any other character which is not part of a number are ignored
	up to the end-of-line.  Blank lines are ignored.
	The first non-blank/commented line gives the number of values per
	column, for subsequent lines.  Subsequent lines must have the
	same number of columns -- blanks in columns are not permitted,
	use 0.0 instead.  However, minimal error checking is performed,
	and if the data is not really in columns, asciiRead can silently
	fail to interpret your file as you would scanning it by eye.

	The read operation will be much faster if the number of commented
	lines is relatively small.  Blank lines cost nothing, while a line
	containing just a "#" is expensive.
